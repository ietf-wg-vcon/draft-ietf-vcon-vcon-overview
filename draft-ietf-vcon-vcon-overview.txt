           The vCon - Conversation Data Container - Overview
                  draft-ietf-vcon-vcon-overview-latest

Abstract

   A vCon is the container for data and information relating to a real-
   time, human conversation.  It is analogous to a [vCard] which enables
   the definition, interchange and storage of an individual's various
   points of contact.  The data contained in a vCon may be derived from
   any multimedia session, traditional phone call, video conference, SMS
   or MMS message exchange, webchat or email thread.  The data in the
   container relating to the conversation may include Call Detail
   Records (CDR), call meta data, participant identity information (e.g.
   STIR PASSporT), the actual conversational data exchanged (e.g. audio,
   video, text), realtime or post conversational analysis and
   attachments of files exchanged during the conversation.  A
   standardized conversation container enables many applications,
   establishes a common method of storage and interchange, and supports
   identity, privacy and security efforts (see [vCon-white-paper])

1.  Introduction

   The generation of conversational data, contained in transcripts and
   multi-media files, is common in business, especially in customer
   facing organizations.  However, the storage, analysis and sharing of
   the data they contain is not currently a standard.  Standardizing a
   container for conversation data (vCon) has numerous advantages, and
   enables the management of the conversation's content.  Very often the
   system providing the communications service, the consumer and/or
   owner of the communications data and the communications analysis
   services are distinct systems and in many case separate business
   entities.  The point of a vCon is to provide a standard means of
   exchanging communications data between these systems and services.
   The use of vCons can ease service integration by using a common
   container and format for enterprise communications.  A vCon becomes
   the standardized input to communication analysis tools and machine
   learning and categorization.  For a sales lead organization, a vCon
   can be the container of assets sold to sales teams.  For
   conversations of record, the vCon can be a legal instrument.  For
   machine learning efforts, vCons can track what information was used
   in the training of models, so that as the result of a customer
   requested deletion of their data, the affected models can be
   identified.

1.1.  What's in a vCon?

   A vCon contains four major categories of data: metadata , dialog ,
   analysis and attachments.  The metadata portion allows for an
   expanded set of data from a typical call detail record ([CDR]), with
   identifications of the participants or parties to the conversation,
   references to related or earlier versions of the vCon.  The dialog
   portion contains a set of multimedia and media type elements, each
   representing the actual, physical conversation in it's original media
   form: text, audio or video.  The analysis portion contains data
   derived from the metadata and dialog portions, intended to carry
   items like transcripts, translations, summaries, text to speech,
   sentiment analysis and other semantic tagging.  Finally, the
   attachment portion contains any other documents, such as slide deck
   or sales lead information, which provides context and support for the
   conversation itself.  The vCon may also container integrity checking
   information such as the issuer of the vCon and tamper-proof features
   such as signatures.

   A vCon acts as the definition of the conversation, and are created by
   systems during and after the conversation itself.  Some communication
   modes, like SMS texting, lack natural session boundaries and require
   explicit definition. vCons may have two or more parties involved, but
   at least one should be a human.  For instance, an interaction between
   a bot and a human is an appropriate scope for vCons, but a
   conversation between two bots would not.

   Due to the size and complexity of some portions of a vCon, both
   inline and externally referenced dialog, analysis, attachments and
   other vCon reference assets are supported.  For instance, vCons may
   reference a video conference media recording as an external URL with
   an accompanying content hash of the contents to detect tampering.
   Alternatively, vCons may directly contain the media of the entire
   dialog internally, keeping the conversation in one place, and
   optionally encrypted.

   vCons are designed to be a digital asset, versioned and signed.  For
   instance, different versions of vCon may arise due to redaction (e.g.
   for PII or other reasons), added analysis or the addition of other
   content.  In the metadata, vCons contain the unique ID of the parent
   vCon, such that they may be traversed while maintaining their data
   integrity and provenance.

1.2.  Use Cases and Requirements

1.2.1.  Contact Center Use Case

1.2.2.  Messaging Use Case

1.2.3.  ECRIT Use Case

   May of the initial set of use cases for vCons are expected to be in
   the interchange between front end and back end application and lower
   layers of the network stack, critical for enablement of analysis of
   conversations.  It is expected that JavaScript handling of vCons in
   the front end and RESTful interfaces and back end platforms will be
   used for operations and manipulation of vCons.  Many media analysis
   services which will be used with vCons, such as transcription,
   already use JSON based interfaces.  For this reason, JSON has been
   chosen for the initial format binding of vCons and the scope of this
   document.  Other bindings (e.g. [CBOR] or [CDDL]) may be consider for
   vCon in the future in other documents.

   An outline of the vCon requirements derived from the explored use
   case follows:

   *  Standardize container for conversational data exchange

   *  Consolidation of data and information for a conversation

   *  Multiple modes of communication, changing over time

   *  Snapshots of conversation during or once completed along with
      analysis

   *  Ease of integration of services and analysis

   *  Better organize conversational data so that it can be handled in a
      consistent, privacy safer means

   *  Immutable

   *  Hiding of PII or entire conversation

   *  Amendable with additional information and data elements

   Define a standard for exchange of conversational data in a sea of
   modes, platforms and service offerings for conversations.

   Example conversational modes and protocols:

   *  SMS

   *  MMS

   *  JABBER

   *  SIMPLE

   *  Proprietary web chat

   *  SMTP

   *  PSTN

   *  SIP

   *  WEBRTC

   *  Proprietary video conferencing

   The following are considered not in scope or non-requirements:

   *  Real-time streaming or updating of conversational data

   *  Transport mechanisms

   *  Storage or databases specifications

   *  Methods of redaction of text, audio or video media

   *  Validation of redactions or appended data beyond the signature of
      the domain making the changes to the conversational data (e.g.
      Merkle tree like redactions)

   *  Standardization of analysis data formats or file media types

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   *  object - JSON object containing key and value pairs

   *  parameter - JSON key and value pair

   *  party - an observer or participant to the conversation, either
      passive or active

   *  payload - the contents or bytes that make up a file

   *  PII - Personal Identifiable Information

   *  PII masked - may include voice recordings, but PII is removed from
      transcripts and recordings (audio and video).

   *  vCon - container for conversational information

   *  vCon instance - a vCon populated with data for a specific
      conversation

   *  vCon instance version - a single version of an instance of a
      conversation, which may be modified to redact or append additional
      information forming a subsequent vCon instance version

   *  vCon syntax version - the version for the data syntax used for
      form a vCon
